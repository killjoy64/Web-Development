// Each time a salesperson sells a car at the Pardeeville New and Used Auto Dealership,
// a record is created containing the salesperson’s name and the amount of the sale.
// Sales of new and used cars are kept in separate files because several reports
// are created for one type of sale or the other. However, management has requested
// a merged file so that all of a salesperson’s sales, whether the vehicle was new or used,
// are displayed together. The following code is intended to merge the files
// that have already been sorted by salesperson ID number.
